# BiggerTask
A TinyTask clone for Linux

This app is basically a Linux Clone of the Windows app "Tinytask", it's written in c++ and is a simple executable allowing you to :
Record events (Mouse movement/clicks, keyboard inputs)
Play them
Save them for later
Load them to reuse them

You can also choose how much long you want them to loop and even make them loop infinitly

To Stop it, click on the "Ctrl" key
THIS WON'T WORK ON WAYLAND (Cuz of security issues)
